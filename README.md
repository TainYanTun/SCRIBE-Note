## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get Scribe up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Composer
*   Node.js & npm (or Yarn)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd scribe
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Copy the environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Generate an application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Configure your database:**
    *   Open the `.env` file and configure your database connection. By default, it uses SQLite. If you want to use SQLite, ensure you have a `database.sqlite` file in the `database/` directory (you can create it with `touch database/database.sqlite`).

6.  **Run database migrations and seeders:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```
    (The `--seed` flag will populate your database with some initial data, including a default user: `test@example.com` / `password`).

7.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR yarn install
    ```

8.  **Compile frontend assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR npm run build for production
    ```

9.  **Start the development server (all-in-one):**
    ```bash
    composer dev
    ```
    This command will concurrently run the Laravel development server, queue worker, logs, and Vite for frontend assets.

    Alternatively, you can run them separately:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

10. **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    composer test
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Register/Login**: Navigate to the application in your browser and register a new account or log in with the seeded user (`test@example.com` / `password`).
2.  **Dashboard**: Get an overview of your notes, tags, and note links.
3.  **Create Notes**: Go to the "Notes" section to create new notes. You can use Markdown for content.
4.  **Manage Tags**: Create and assign tags to your notes to categorize them.
5.  **Link Notes**: Connect related notes to build your knowledge graph.
6.  **Graph View**: Explore the relationships between your notes in the dedicated graph view.
